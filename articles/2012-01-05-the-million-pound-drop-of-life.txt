You start with one million pounds, you battle through eight rounds of multiple choice questions - you can go all in, or you can spread you bets. The show is great fun to watch, and very tense.

I was thinking about <cite>The Million Pound Drop</cite> on New Year's Day at church. What if it wasn't Â£1 million that was on the line, but *everything* you have - tangible and intangible? If all of your possessions, relationships, your future, your personality, your career were on the table - and you had four options, what would you put them on?

Would you put it all on yourself? Spread it between hard-work and logic? Would it all go on luck?

When it's all on the line, where do I place my bets? 

Often, Christianity is described as a comfort blanket - a way of making people feel better about themselves and their future; a safe bet, if you will. But that's not how Jesus described it. 

At one point he suggests his disciples will need a cross like his to follow him.

In [Matthew 13:44](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2013:44&version=ESV) he describes the Kingdom of God like a hidden treasure in a field:

>"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field."

The man sells *all that he has* to receive this treasure.

When [one disciple says to Jesus](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10:28-30&version=ESV), "We have left everything to follow you!", he promises:

> "there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life"

What's the point? Jesus calls Christians to put everything on him. Money, relationships, houses - everything. To be a Christian, is to go 'all in' on Jesus. To be prepared to face life's trials, and even the Great Drop of death, with everything on Jesus.

Paul later put it this way in his first letter to the people in Corinth:

> "If our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world."

In other words, Paul says he's **putting everything on Jesus' resurrection**, and there being a future resurrection to come, being historical facts - and if he's wrong, you should feel for him the way you might feel for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKdt4VVo7XQ" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">these people</a>.

What about you? What are you going all in for? What are you putting everything on to face The Drop?
